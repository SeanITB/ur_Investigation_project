# ur_Investigation_project

### What's about
In this repository, I will upload all the content that I'm studying and trying by myself :).
For the moment, I have work in two diferent projects. I will explain briefly what I've done and put a link in each one. 

### XMLrpc conection to a ur3 cobot
On a computer with a *server XMLrpc* I have host the connection with the *client ur3 cobot*, with a simple *kotlin* program.

### Toolpath and OpenCV
In the end, the project didn't work out, but in the process I have learned a couple of things. Such as some basics of OpenCV, like converting a picture in an edge drawing, and understand how the *urcap toolpath* works, which are the steps and their implementations.
